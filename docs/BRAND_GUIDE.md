# 🌲 Huellas del Norte - Brand Identity Guide

## 🎨 Visual Philosophy: "Premium Nature"
Our design language reflects the rugged beauty of Northern Spain. It is **wild yet sophisticated**, combining the raw textures of nature with modern, clean minimalism.

### Core Values
- **Authenticity**: Real images, organic shapes.
- **Clarity**: High contrast, legible typography, no clutter.
- **Warmth**: Despite the dark theme, using warm accents (clay, earth) to convey approachability.

## 🎨 Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Forest Green** (`#4a7a67`): The heart of our brand. Represents the forests of Euskadi and Navarra. heavily used for primary buttons and active states.
- **Deep Slate** (`#1a1e1b`): Our main background. Not pure black, but a very dark, rich green-grey pine tone.

### Secondary Colors
- **Moss Grey** (`#3d4a44`): Used for cards, inputs, and secondary elements. A bridge between the background and content.
- **Mist White** (`#e2e8f0`): Our primary text color. Softer than pure white to reduce eye strain.

### Accent
- **Clay Pink** (`#c27ba0`): A warm, unexpected accent color derived from sandstone and clay. Used sparingly for calls to action (CTAs) and highlights.

## 🔠 Typography
We use **Inter** (or similar modern sans-serif) for its readability and neutrality, allowing the photography to stand out.

- **Headings**: Bold, tight tracking.
- **Body**: Regular weight, generous line height for readability.
